# Array to hold image IDs. Note that it is not necessary to provide the entire
# image ID. Just the first few characters is sufficient.
# Use "docker images" at the command prompt to find image IDs
# Image IDs are entered on the command line separate by a space.

# Changelog
# Added instructional language prior to script execution - DB

# Added ability to exit the script in the event that user failed to include
# a key requirement - DB

# Change code to use an environment variable for location to write image archives -DB

# Added option to not delete archived docker images after Docker reset
